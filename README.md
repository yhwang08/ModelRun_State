This repository contains the codes for LSTM, MCR-LSTM, and S4D-FT model runs for each U.S. state using CAMELS dataset.

MCR-LSTM is introduced in:
Wang, Y., Zhang, L., Erichson, N. B., & Yang, T. (2025). A Mass Conservation Relaxed (MCR) LSTM Model for Streamflow Simulation across CONUS. Water Resources Research, 61(8), e2024WR039131.

S4D-FT is presented in:
Wang, Y., Zhang, L., Yu, A., Erichson, N. B., & Yang, T. (2025). A Deep State Space Model for Rainfallâ€“Runoff Simulations. arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.14980.

For regional train across CONUS on GPU, refer to the shared repo specified in the above two papers. 

How to Run the Code

Prepare state shapefiles
Create a folder named state_shps in the project directory.
Place the shapefiles for your target state inside a subfolder named [statename]_shp (e.g., kansas_shp).

Download the CAMELS dataset
Download and extract the CAMELS dataset to a local directory.

Preprocess data
Run the following script to prepare the state-level inputs:

python common/prepare_from_camels_by_state_geo.py


Update the variables camels_root (path to the CAMELS dataset) and state_name inside the script as needed.

Train and test models
Run train.py inside each model folder to train and evaluate the models:

python LSTM/train.py
python MCRLSTM/train.py
python S4DFT/train.py


Integrate results
After training is complete, merge outputs and statistics:

python combine_all_model_output.py
python combine_all_model_stats.py
